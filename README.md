# Gotta match 'em all!

Gotta match 'em all is a Pokemon memory game! Based around the first 151 Pokemon which features images and additional data that is captured dynamically from the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co). 

It is a Single Page Application (SPA) which is built from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to play

- Click a card to see the Pokemon beneath, then click another.

- If you get a match they will stay face up, if not they will flip back and you'll need to remember what was hiding beneath it again. 

- Repeat until all the Pokemon are matched! 

- Try for a place on the High Score Table! (or ust delete the scores so you can be the very best!)
